# Math, Logic and Programming
****
**Rationale:**

This project is intended to serve as a learning material from which readers can explore the parallelisms of math, logic, and programming. 
This is a practical guide to explore and express concepts in different languages. In particular, Python, Julia and Java. Topics from computational sciences, algorithms and data structures will be compiled in this repo. 

****
In Python

We will explore the concepts and features from the [SciPy Projects](https://www.scipy.org/docs.html). And make useful projects for applying the concepts we learned in the notebooks.
