# Project Gamma 
****
**Rationale:**

This project is intended to serve as a learning material from which readers can explore the parallelisms of math, logic, and programming. 
This is a practical guide to explore and express concepts in different languages. In particular, Python, Julia, C++ and Java. Topics from computational sciences, algorithms and data structures, and programming methods will be compiled in this repo. 

****
In Python

We will explore the concepts and features from the [SciPy Projects](https://www.scipy.org/docs.html). And make useful projects for applying the concepts we learned in the notebooks. We will explore the features of the Python language such as functional programming, object-oriented programming, and extensions for high-level computations. 

****
In Julia

We will explore the essential features of the Julia language, and express the same projects in Python. We will explore the features of the Python language such as functional programming, object-oriented programming, and extensions for high-level computations. 

****
In Java and C++

We will explore the construction of algorithms and data structures. We will explore the kinds of programming paradigms namely functional, templative(generic), and object-oriented.

**Note:** This shall be maintained overtime, to those of you who are willing to help develop this project you may contribute to the repo.
