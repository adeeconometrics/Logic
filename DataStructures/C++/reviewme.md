- namespaces
    - aliases - You can use an alias declaration to declare a name to use as a synonym for a previously declared type. (This mechanism is also referred to informally as a type alias). You can also use this mechanism to create an alias template, which can be particularly useful for custom allocators.
    ```
    syntax:
    using <identifier> = <type>;
    typedef <type> <identifier>;
    ```
    - note:
        - typedef's are useful for providing clarity with the purpose of your code, not only that it improves the readability of your code but it also allows your code to be easily modified. By the same token, however, it abstracts the underlying types for your variables. It is ideal to use typedefs within a given scope.

- variables    
    - scopes - delimits the accessibility of your variables
    - local (scoped) static variables -  are variables that live for the entirety of program execution; they
    preserve their value.

- pointers and referneces 
    - initialize `<type>*<identifier> = &<var>`
    - access `*<identifier>`
        - also called as the dereferencing operator 
    - reference `<type>& <identifier>=<referenced var>`
        - you need to declare them upon initialization

   [When to use Structs over Classes?](https://en.cppreference.com/book/intro/classes)
    - The only technical different between the two is the Structs are public by default while
    classes are private, the reason one should use struct over classes is when grouping values 
    pertaining a set of heterogeneous variables wherein functionalities are only concerned with 
    those values. It should also be noted that some compilers throws a warning for inheriting structs
    and adding more complexity therein.
