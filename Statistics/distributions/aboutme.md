currently supported features:
- probability distribution function and probability mass function
- cumulative distribution function 
- central moments 
    - mean 
    - median
    - mode 
- variance, skewness, kurtosis
- p value
----
features to be developed:
- plotting probability distribution
    - plain
    - fill-in between gradient 
- random variable generator 
- moment generating functions 
- entropy
- fisher information
- point-percentage function
